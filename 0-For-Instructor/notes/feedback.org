* matt notes

too long

include video or screenshot of game in agenda, for motivation and context

aliasing explanation good


cut slide with circles and sqaures slide.
mapping

cut Swift support for FP.
- refer to it in the demo

remove remove NSMutableArray.
just use class vs struct

only switch from =class MCell= to =struct Cell=.

emphasize that:
- OO requires maintaining a mental map of references vs object.
- FP does not.

mention map,filter,reduce only in passing.

focus on aliasing, immutability

devise exercises focus on aliasing.

device exercises focused on immutability.

* ray notes

- explain the introduction of the map function in more detail.
1. first define argument function with a contextual name
2. then refactor all arg names to represent it generically
3. then show it as call to map

- don't use the closure argument shorthand $0

- add more links to other resourcs at the end

- better job explaining when and why of class, struct, immutable.
